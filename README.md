# Natours-project

This is my representation of a Natours-project which is a part of Jonas Schmedtmann course "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!". This project is focused 
on teaching about SCSS, whole CSS architecture it contains a lot of great animations. 
The main layout of the page is originally based on floats but instead of this i used flexbox.
